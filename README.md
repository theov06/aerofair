**🛫 AeroFair – AI + DeFi for Fair Flight Pricing
**

AeroFair is an autonomous agent that protects travelers from airline price gouging in real time.
Powered by LLMs, on-chain escrow, and NFT rebates, AeroFair negotiates, secures, and refunds flight fares — ensuring travelers always pay the fairest possible price.

**🚀 Overview
**

Airline ticket prices fluctuate wildly, often due to hidden algorithms and dynamic pricing. AeroFair fights back by combining AI intelligence with crypto transparency:

🧠 Detects unfair pricing in real time using machine-learning models trained on historical flight data.

🤖 Negotiates the best available fare through airline APIs and OTA feeds.

💵 Locks your booking funds in a USDC escrow on Polygon for security and accountability.

🎟️ Refunds any overcharge automatically through rebate NFTs, which can be redeemed or traded.

**💡 Key Features
**

Autonomous LLM Agent – Uses natural-language inputs like “Book me a flight from Toronto to Paris under $500.”

DeFi Escrow – Transparent, non-custodial USDC smart contract for holding and releasing payments.

Dynamic RAG Memory – Remembers user preferences and previous routes for smarter negotiation.

Rebate NFTs – Unique tokens proving refund eligibility and creating a loyalty ecosystem.
